This is a repository for research on indoor localization based on wireless
fingerprinting techniques. For more details, please visit [[http://kyeongsoo.github.io/research/projects/indoor_localization/index.html][XJTLU SURF project

We [[python/indoor_localization-2.ipynb][replace the activation functions of the hidden-layer from 'tanh' to 'relu']]
per the second answer to [[https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/218542/which-activation-function-for-output-layer][this qustion]]. The results are [[results/indoor_localization-2_20170813.csv][here]] (nh: number of
hidden layer nodes, dr: dropout rate, acc: accuracy). Compared to the case with
'tanh', however, the results seem to not improve (a bit inline with the
gut-feeling suggestions from [[https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/10048/what-is-the-best-keras-model-for-multi-class-classification][this]]).

We first try [[python/indoor_localization-1.ipynb][a feed-forward classifier with just one hidden layer]] per the
comments from [[https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/181/how-to-choose-the-number-of-hidden-layers-and-nodes-in-a-feedforward-neural-netw][this]]. The results are [[results/indoor_localization-1_20170812.csv][here]] (* /nh/: number of hidden layer nodes,
/dr/: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dropout_(neural_networks)][dropout]] rate, /loss/: [[http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/library/tensor/nnet/nnet.html#theano.tensor.nnet.nnet.categorical_crossentropy][categorical cross-entropy]], /acc/: accuracy *).
